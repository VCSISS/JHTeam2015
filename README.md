9/3/15 Version 1.1

This is the code we planned to fly; however, it does not output the event byte into the text files. We will be changing that in the next update.

Major Changes:

We changed the event table to take pictures after 10-7-5-3 hour intervals from the original 10-8-6. Our logic is that we will get the same amount of complete iterations (3) except that we will get more data.

Minor Changes:

We changed the event bytes to redirect to the "take photo" event to save memory. We also shortened the output statements.
